I chose to use logistic regression for all of them, to get a good comparison of how well I could get a PCA-Logreg to work across the board.
It seemed to work fairly well for the Breast Cancer Dataset, and for the Iris dataset, except for the Iris 0 vs all. I remain uncertain as to why this one was so different.
I used 16 PCs for BC, because it seemed to be a good mix of reducing the number of components meaningfully and still maintaining accuracy.
I used 3 PCs for each of the Iris tests because it didn't seem to want to go any lower.
